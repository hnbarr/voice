what applies to me, as a user:
How to register, am I regisered?

Voting for me: zip code look up for finding out what county/detalineslinfo for state/local voting, where to vote, dates for early voting, info on abstee voting (later develop link - information on qualifying for absteentee voting)

Local page with info on canidades, positions, descriptions of roles, passed and current acts/beliefs/stands on 

Education: highlight of app, need to bring in informatin on gov positions, definintions (by tool tips)


button - am I registered? How to register? Deadlines (zip code entry) -> direct to landing page with registration info on local elections & separate landing pages with same purpose/functionality for state elections and us elections. 

vote component buttons: 
- register now 
- am I registered? 
- registration information (local, state, us): absentee voting rules, qualifications, deadlines for your area


How to make my voice heard- educational piece! This is where the info on the government positions and what they do, what they control.
